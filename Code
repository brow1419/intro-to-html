            <p>To intro this I guess i'll discuss why I got into coding, the short answer is because several games I played wouldn't have specific community mods that filled my niche so I sought to make my own in a version of c++.</p>
            <p>The other reason why I got into coding is I enjoy seeing how things work behind the scenes, so coding provides an interesting angle behind the web and see hidden details that otherwise would go unnoticed.</p>
